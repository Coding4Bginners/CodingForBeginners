  <dt>Q:  How beginner is Coding for Beginners?</dt>
    <dd></dd>
    <dt>A:  I had maybe italicized some type in emails &lt;i&gt; and worked on one Wordpress project before I signed up for a coding class&mdash;I had never done any programming. As I run up the first version of this site, I've begun to learn HTML and CSS. My notes start from the beginning, and the site reflects how little I know. (I mean how much! How <i>much</i> I know.) <br> </dt>
    <br> 
    <dd></dd>
    <dt>Q:  What coding class did you take? Was it helpful? </dt>
    <dt>A:  I'm in the middle of an 80-hour free class offered by the New York Public Library. Project Code introduces HTML and CSS in its first term and Javascript in its second. If you're in the area, you can test and lottery into the next term. The test is a ten-minute check of your ability to 1. show up and 2. pilot a mouse through a few windows. The lottery checks your times against the upcoming class schedule, and choses people for the in-demand times. 
If there are no similar free or cheap resources where you live, look online for meetups&mdash;the most useful thing about class has been learning with other humans&mdash;and for a firehose of information. More at this list of <a href=/resources.html>resources</a>.<br> </dt>
    <br> 
    <dt>Q:  Apart from taking a class and messing around with projects like this site, what else has been useful? </dt>
    <dt>A:  My information-gathering started with the NYPL's own slim, housemade textbook, but one of the first things it covered was how to look for more online. Getting what you need from reference sites like W3Schools and MDN is a useful skill in itself, and supplementing your learning with online services like codeacademy helps.<br>
I've also looked at Harvard's gigantic and very well-resourced mooc, CS50, a broad introduction to computer science, and some Lynda videos free through the library's subscription, which are slow but useful. There is so much out there. It is mind boggling. <br> 
This project is helping, because writing stuff down really cements it in your brain. See also the stack of handwritten index cards in my bag. <br></dt>
